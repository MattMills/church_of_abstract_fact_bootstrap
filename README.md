# church_of_abstract_fact_bootstrap

## introduction
  Purpose: The purpose of the church of abstract fact is multi-fold. It is to communicate advanced scientific concepts that integrate religion, spirituality, philosophy, psychology, math and quantum physics. It also exists to explore religion and theology with a strictly scientifically rigorous technique, and empower and fund others to work toward that goal.
  
  Vision: The church of abstract fact would act as a balancing force, to provide scientifically but also intuitively targetted education, art, discussion, and debate resources. Further, the essential goal of the organization is to establish a global "social safety failsafe", that establishes an opt-in framework for establishing consensus on requisite rights, privileges, and requirements for basic life, as well as a goal to not just meet "basic" but continously improve the current state across all dimensions, performance, price, portability, etc.
  

## personal statement

  I believe strange personal experience and biological mutation in my developmentary process has allowed a strange level of insight into the physical nature of reality. Essentially that the universe has changed it's evolutionary requirements from competition to cooperation, and we must now translate all of our systems in order to correct for that. I believe there are fundamental limitations of our cognitive biology that prevent us from directly cognizing and understanding the nature of the universe, which requires a form of "abstract truth", essentially, something that is in the shape of the truth, that you will iteratively understand more of. 

  

  A truth with a fractal nature.
  

## core principles

  **Abstract fact**: A fact based in physical reality, that while can be understood in a very abstract sense, is essentially incompatible with our own biological evolutionary requirements, until we are able to use our brains neuro-plasticity to teach us how 
to understand the physical fact.


  **Paradox**: The word "paradox" is incorrectly defined. It doesn't mean what a paradox actually is. Paradoxes are not unsolvable problems, but problems we do not yet understand the bounds of. Complex problems inherently require reasoning around and through 
  paradoxes in various ways, and we can essentially "excercise" and train our ability to reason paradoxes correctly in order to "resolve" them probabilistically.

  
  **Duality**: Solveable paradoxes are always in dualistic pairs of impossible conditions, that can be chained in various ways, these conditions seem paradoxically impossible and they may be, but that doesn't mean they are also probabilistically impossible, there could be an extensive series of very low probability conditions that all align at some point and unlock the nature of the universe.

  
  **Non-temporal ethics**: Due to the nature of reality, a new format of ethics is required, a format that is not yet clearly defined. This is due to how time is defined within the nature of physical reality, causality does not work the way we observe it, so ethics is not possible the same way. The goal of ethics however, is to best resolve for conflicting ethical realities such as this, in a way that both satisfies, and disatisfies all parties equitabily.

## conclusion
Call to action: Consider this a call to non-action, or action, at your own choosing. Feel free to act or not as you wish, that is the entire point. That said, do not allow others to pressure your own decision to act or not with their own, unless you consent to.
Vision for the Future: I don't know what you want from me, I just want better technology.

# Non temporal ethics 101

Consider how ethics would work in a universe without time. If events do not have causes, but rather causes have events essentially, what is intent, what is choice, what is ethical?
